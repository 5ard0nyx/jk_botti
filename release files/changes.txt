JK_botti

[0.17]
 - Config-files come with binary packages
 - Dropped Opposing Force support
 - Tweaked down gauss/tau settings
 - Bots run away from RPG laser spot (like they do for grenades, satchels, snarks and rockets)

[0.16]
 - Lost all records on what has changed since HPB-bot :P
   - Basicly changes where (this is written over 1,5 years after 0.16 release):
     - Bot keeps firing-button down when having good aim until runs out of ammo, 
       HPB_bot kept clicking fire button with extreme delays between 
       shots (even with machine guns)
     - Human players jump and duck around, so do JK_botti.
     - Merged BotAim plugin into JK_botti, for more realistic aim.
     - Some time handling code changes to handle better low running server 
       cpu (missing frames), I used to run JK_botti on Athlon 800mhz
     - Stripped all mods except HLDM(valve) and OP4DM/CTF(gearbox)
     - Remove bot_strafe_percent setting, strafe percent is now linked to
       bot skillz.
     - Added randomize_bots_on_mapchange setting, create bots with new
       values for next map, default value: 0.
     - Added turn_method setting, for selecting BotAim plugin aim code,
       1 = old RACC code, 2 = new RACC code, default value: 2.
     - Added botthinkfps setting, to limit reaction rate of bots to human
       levels and reduce CPU usage, default value: 30.
     - Added bot_add_level_tag setting, enable [lvlX] tag to bot name,
       default value: 0.
 - Based on HPB-bot by botman and BotAim plugin by Pierre-Marie Baty
